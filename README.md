# One Node

Let's talk about our project. Our idea revolves around building a simple, easy to use and most importantly secure framework which handles connected objects.
The idea is simple: the more objects you connect to the Internet, the more you open yourself and your precious data to malicious attackers. In our framework, all the objects are interfacing with the user through a single node, which minimizes attack vectors.
This node offers modular support for any and every IoT object, so that any developer can easily implement their own objects or APIs without having to worry about security or compatibility issues. Developers can even expand upon already existing objects and APIs thanks to the modularity of our framework. The icing on the cake is our API/app store, which allows anybody to upload or download and use APIs other people have made. Just connect your object, click "download" and enjoy a smooth and secure IoT experience.
